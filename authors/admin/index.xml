      <description>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Lille, in the CRIStAL labs. My research work revolves around techniques, algorithms and abstractions for the static analysis of binary code, and a better understanding of its underlying structures. When not on a whiteboard, I develop prototypes for the OTAWA WCET tool. I have also been granted teaching duties at the Polytech engineering school.
I received my PhD in static program analysis from the University of Toulouse III where I was delighted to work closely with Hugues Cass√© on OTAWA.</description>
